### Welcome

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tool that helps game developers record players in-game to provide insight into what players struggle with. Follow the progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RecoludeReal) or DM me if you want access to the beta. [Demo here](https://recolude.gitlab.io/webplayer-module/recolude-webplayer/).
- In my freetime I'm working on a tutorial series that walks you through building your own 3D Mesh generation library. You can start on the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM5EykxswWs) or take a [look at the code](https://github.com/EliCDavis/mango) so far.
