- Founder of [Shapurr](https://shapurr.com/), a website where users can create and share their procedural 3D models.
- I work on a procedural mesh editing and generation library named [Polyform](https://github.com/EliCDavis/polyform). A few utility libraries have spawned from it's undertaking as well that might be useful to others:
  - [node-flow](https://github.com/EliCDavis/node-flow) - Another flow-based node graph library
  - [vector](https://github.com/EliCDavis/vector) - Immutable vector math library
  - [jbtf](https://github.com/EliCDavis/jbtf) - GLTF-inspired JSON schema for embedding arbitrary binaries
  - [quill](https://github.com/EliCDavis/quill) - Scheduler of operations on in-memory data
  - [sfm](https://github.com/EliCDavis/sfm) - Utilities for interacting with reconstruction data from different SFM programs
  - [iter](https://github.com/EliCDavis/iter) - Iterator and utilities. Some inspiration from ReactiveX
  - [bitlib](https://github.com/EliCDavis/bitlib) - Utilities for reading and writing binary data
