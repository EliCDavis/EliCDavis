### Eli C Davis

- Founder of [Recolude](https://recolude.com/), a startup that helps game developers record players in-game to provide insight into how their application is used. Follow the progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RecoludeLLC) or DM me if you have special usecases. [Demo here](https://app.recolude.com/recording?id=37f0e5e2-f884-46c4-a1d8-72ae959a7fa2).
- In my free time, I work on a procedural mesh editing and generation library named [Polyform](https://github.com/EliCDavis/polyform). A few utility libraries have spawned from it's undertaking as well that might be useful to others:
  - [node-flow](https://github.com/EliCDavis/node-flow) - Another flow-based node graph library
  - [vector](https://github.com/EliCDavis/vector) - Immutable vector math library
  - [jbtf](https://github.com/EliCDavis/jbtf) - GLTF-inspired JSON schema for embedding arbitrary binaries
  - [quill](https://github.com/EliCDavis/quill) - Scheduler of operations on in-memory data
  - [sfm](https://github.com/EliCDavis/sfm) - Utilities for interacting with reconstruction data from different SFM programs
  - [iter](https://github.com/EliCDavis/iter) - Iterator and utilities. Some inspiration from ReactiveX
  - [bitlib](https://github.com/EliCDavis/bitlib) - Utilities for reading and writing binary data
