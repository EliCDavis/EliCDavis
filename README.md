- Founder of [Recolude](https://recolude.com/), a startup that helps game developers record players in-game to provide insight into how their application is used. Follow the progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RecoludeLLC) or DM me if you have special usecases. [Demo here](https://app.recolude.com/recording?id=37f0e5e2-f884-46c4-a1d8-72ae959a7fa2).
