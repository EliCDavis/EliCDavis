### Welcome

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tool that helps game developers record players in-game to provide insight into what players struggle with. Follow the progress on [twitter](https://twitter.com/RecoludeLLC) or DM me if you want access to the beta. [Demo here](https://app.recolude.com/recording?id=37f0e5e2-f884-46c4-a1d8-72ae959a7fa2).
- In my freetime I work on a procedural mesh generation library names [Polyform](https://github.com/EliCDavis/polyform).
